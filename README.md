### Tic-Tac-Toe

This is an interactive X and O game where the default user's shape is 'X', while the computer's shape is 'O'.

After 3 rounds, it checks if the user wins or loses. If the user wins, then the game will restart.

- The check win function checks all possible arrangements of 'X' or 'O' that could be recorded as a win.
- It uses a boolean to record True if the arrangement of 'X' or 'O' matches any of those arrangements.
- If it does not, then it's a draw.
